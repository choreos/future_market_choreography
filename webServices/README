Inside each WS folder, run:
- Before importing project in Eclipse IDE
  $ mvn -Dwtpversion=2.0 eclipse:eclipse
- If you just want to build the war file (in target/)
  $ mvn package

If the project requires rehearsal, add it as a provided dependency, otherwise javax/servlet and javax/el will conflict with tomcat ones.
